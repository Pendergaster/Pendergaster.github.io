  ## My personal GitHub pages

Projects hosted here do not represent anyone other than myself and most of them are for fun anyways. 

Hi! I am a young and enthusiastic programmer from Finland. Currently, I am at the end, of my bachelor of engineering studies. 
I enjoy programming in C and C++. All my projects, here in GitHub, have been done in school or free time. 
Most of my GitHub projects are in C because I find it to be a great and simple tool to work with and it forces me to implement my own data structures and algorithms.
I find it to be a great way to learn.

Professionally I have used both C and C++. I also have experience in some scripting languages, like Bash, Python, and Lua.
The best skill that I can provide is enthusiasm for programming and learning!

# Some of the projects

- [NES-emulator](https://github.com/Pendergaster/nes-emu)

This is implementation of NES emulator. The goal of the project was to visualize how the NES platform works. This also includes a 6502-assembly code debugger for NES cartridges.

- [HTTPS webserver](https://github.com/Pendergaster/CWebDevAdventure)

This project's goal was to implement an HTTPS web server in C, which can respond to queries and serve webpages. We used the HTTP 1.1 protocol. The server was able to compile, run, and output C-code given by the browser. Served webpage had WebGL background compiled by Emscripten. This was obviously just a fun project for learning!

- [x11 Snipping tool utility](https://github.com/Pendergaster/snippy)

This tool can capture part of your screen for the user to paste it to applications. This is a utility for my personal needs and currently **work in progress**. Although this works but has problems with how some applications handle x11 clipboard.

The bright part of the image is the selected region for capturing

- [Multiplayer engine with 3D Bullet physics](https://github.com/Pendergaster/MultiplayerMotor)

This engine's goal was to simulate 3D Bullet physics in a multiplayer environment. Raknet was used for network and OpenGL for rendering. Done as part of a school project.

- [Vulkan render](https://github.com/Pendergaster/Basic-vulkan)

This project was part of my graphics programming studies. Provides basic Vulkan render foundation for other projects. This was a great project to learn from! This project followed fairly closely [online tutorials](https://vulkan-tutorial.com/)

- [Oculus VR engine with OpenGL rendering](https://github.com/Pendergaster/VRstuff)

The project's goal was to implement VR rendering from scratch. I decided to use the Ovr library by Oculus. Project integrated 3D Bullet physics and animation pipeline.

- [CHIP-8 emulator](https://github.com/Pendergaster/chip8-emu)

CHIP-8 project was my first introduction to emulation theory. It includes simple OpenGL rendering.
